        <p style="text-align: justify;line-height: 30px;">

          Children are the future of a nation. For an emerging country like India, 

          development of underprivileged children holds the key to the progress of the nation itself, 

          and their education is the cornerstone of this progress. But education for children cannot be achieved without 

          ensuring the welfare of the family â€“ a child can go to school regularly only when the family,

          particularly the mother is healthy and empowered; the family has decent livelihood opportunities and a steady income.<br><br>

          Realizing this, Smile Foundation, beginning in the corridors of education, 

          has adopted a lifecycle approach with intensive programmes focused on family health, 

          livelihood and community engagement through women empowerment, which addresses the needs of less privileged children,
           
          heir families and the larger community.

                  Mission Education, the education programme of Smile Foundation provides basic education and healthcare to underprivileged children,

                  with the belief that education is both the means as well as the end to a better life because it empowers an individual to earn his/her 
                  
                  livelihood while also increasing one's awareness on a range of issues; 

                  in the process helping him/her evolve as a better citizen.
